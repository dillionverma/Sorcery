## How to work with github

Before you begin writing code, do the following:
1. `git checkout master` - switch to master branch before you do anything else
2. `git pull origin master` - get latest code from github
3. `git checkout -b new_branch_name` - create a new branch which is now identical to master

Once done a small portion of code, do the following:
1. `git add .` - add everything you did to staging area
2. `git commit -m "what i did in my code"` - tell us what you did in your code you wrote
3. `git push origin new_branch_name` - push ur code and branch to github

Once you are done your whole feature and want to merge to master:
1. Go to https://github.com/AllanMukundi/Sorcery/pulls and open a **New pull request**
2. The base branch should be `master`, the compare branch should be `new_branch_name`
3. Click **Create pull request**
4. Notify team that you have created a pull request so we can review
5. To finally merge branch to master after all team members approve, click **Merge** on the pull request on github
